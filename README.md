# hello-world-kubernetes
Sample project for testing the capabilities of Kubernetes and ArgoCD

# Motivation

This project is just a bunch of files that I'm using to configure and run some tasks in my personal installation of *MicroK8S*, 
where I want to deploy a Java application besides an *ArgoCD* service to automatically track the state of an github repository,
where the *Kubernetes* configuration belongs.
